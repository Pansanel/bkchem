    <h2>How to create a custom plugin for BKChem</h2>

    <h3>What is a plugin</h3>

    <p>From version <b>0.10.0-pre1</b> BKChem supports custom plugins, that is pieces of code that
    can be inserted into BKChem without need of modification of the program. These are typically
    written by users and provide some minor enhancements to the functionality of the program.</p>

    <h3>How does BKChem handle plugins</h3>

    <p>A BKChem plugin in general consists of two main parts. The first one is a short XML file that
    describes the plugin. If you don't know anything about XML, just don't worry. It is so easy that even
    I understand it :). The second part is a <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> script that
    is the actual code of the plugin.</p>

    <p>On startup BKChem searches in predefined directories (<i>plugins</i> directory in the BKChem installation
    directory and <i>plugins</i> directory in the users <i>.bkchem</i> directory - located either in the installation
    directory or the users HOME directory) and tries to read
    all XML files (having extension .xml) and find if they describe some plugin. If yes, it performs
    an action depending on the type of plugin.</p>

    <p>At the time of writing of this document there are two distinct types of plugins that BKChem
    supports. The default (and probably most interesting one) is the <b>script plugin</b>. For such
    a plugin an entry into the menu is added and the plugin code is executed when the entry is
    selected.</p>

    <p>The second type of plugin is <b>mode plugin</b>. Modes are used in BKChem to provide different
    types of actions to perform on the drawn objects. They are represented by the main toolbar of the
    program. There is an "edit mode", "draw mode", "rotate mode" etc. A plugin of this type adds a
    new mode to BKChem, enabling a new functionality. It is a little more complicated matter, because
    it implies a deeper knowledge of BKChem to write such a plugin, and therefore is not described in
    this material, yet.</p>


    <h3>Writing a script plugin - brief tutorial</h3>

    <h4>Foreword</h4>

    <p>As mentioned above a plugin consist of two separate files - a XML document describing the
    plugin and a Python script containing the actual code. In case of script plugin, the only file
    that is read on BKChem startup is the XML file. If this file is successfully read, an entry is
    added to the <i>Plugins</i> menu. The Python script is not executed until requested by the
    user.</p>

    <p>This fact has two major implications:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>a successful startup of BKChem and appearance of the
      entry in BKChem menu does not mean the plugin will actually work
      </li>
      <li>each time you run the plugin from the menu, its source is re-read. This means that as long
      as your plugin does not cause some inconsistencies in the internal state of the program, you
      may debug and modify the plugin without restarting BKChem.
      </li>
    </ul>


    <h4>The XML specification file</h4>

    <p>The XML file describing the plugin is very short and simple as you can see on this
    example:</p>


<pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

&lt;plugin>

  &lt;meta>
    &lt;author email="beda@zirael.org">Beda Kosata&lt;/author>
    &lt;description>
      Finds all aromatic bonds in the current drawing (paper) and marks them
      by setting their color to red.
    &lt;/description>
  &lt;/meta>

  &lt;source>
    &lt;file>red_aromates.py&lt;/file>
    &lt;menu-text lang="en">Mark aromatic bonds&lt;/menu-text>
    &lt;menu-text lang="cs">Označ aromatické vazby&lt;/menu-text>
  &lt;/source>
&lt;/plugin>
</pre>



    <p>The only necessary part is
    content of the <b>&lt;source></b> tag, where the <b>&lt;file></b> tag says which file contains
    the Python script and the <b>&lt;menu-text></b> tag says how the entry in the "Plugins" menu
    for this plugin should be called.</p>

    <p>The sample config file contains also a <b>meta</b> tag with information about the author and
    the function of the plugin. It is considered good habit to provide these information if you are
    going to distribute your plugins to other people. The description of the function of the plugin
    will be shown in the program status-bar when the cursor is over the plugin menu entry.
    </p>

    <p>Both the <b>&lt;menu-text></b> and <b>&lt;description</b> elements may have an optional
    <i>lang</i> attribute, that says in what language the text is. In this case more than one 
    such elements may be present with different <i>lang</i> attributes. BKChem will choose the one
    that corresponds to the current language setting or uses the first one, if no matching language
    is found.</p>

    <h4>The Python script</h4>

    <p>The heart (or maybe brain) of the plugin is the Python script. Inside this script you can use
    any Python functions you want, there is no limit. <b>WARNING: Because of this, the plugins
    present a possible threat to your computer. A plugin from an unknown source may delete all data
    from you harddisk, send your private emails to strange people or even drink all your beer and
    kick you out of your own house - you have been warned.</b></p>

    <p>The way how the script communicates with BKChem is via a global variable <i>App</i> that
    represents the instance of the BKChem application. You may call its methods, retrieve its
    attributes etc.</p>

    <p>Bellow is a sample script that find all aromatic bonds in all molecules present on the
    current paper and sets their color to dark red.</p>

    <pre>
# at first we cancel all selections
App.paper.unselect_all()

# App.paper is the current paper
# App.paper.molecules is a list of all molecules on this paper
for mol in App.paper.molecules:

  # the aromaticity of bonds is not checked by default
  # therefore we must at first call the mark_aromatic_bonds() method
  mol.mark_aromatic_bonds()

  # then we can loop over all the bonds
  # and change the color of all the aromatic ones
  for b in mol.bonds:
    if b.aromatic:
      b.line_color = "#aa0000"
      b.redraw()
    </pre>

    <p>After the script finishes a new undo record is started automatically, therefor any changes by the plugin
    are undoable in one step.</p>


    <h4>Last word</h4>

    <p>There are some sample plugins distributed together with BKChem (in the directory plugins
    under the main BKChem directory (not the /bkchem/bkchem/plugins, but /bkchem/plugins). Some of
    them are pretty simple, some a little more complex. Feel free to use them for studying or as
    starting material for your own scripts.
    </p>
