>3.1. Native formats</A
></H1
><P
>Native format of BKChem is based on XML and is called CDML (chemical drawing markup
	  language). This format is, on contrary to CML (chemical markup language) which is designed
	  to describe the chemistry from the semantic point of view, designed to describe the
	  chemical drawing from the perspective of representation.</P
><P
>CDML is however just internal format of BKChem and does not have any broad
	  acceptance. To use the graphical output of BKChem it was necessary to export the data into
	  some standard graphical format, preferentially SVG. This approach has however disadvantage
	  that it forces users to maintain two versions of each document, one with data for BKChem
	  and one with their graphical representation. Fortunately it is possible to embed foreign
	  data into SVG and because SVG is ideal format for vector graphics I have
	  embedded CDML into it. This way we have format (available from version 0.1.1) that
	  can be immediately viewed in 
	  SVG enabled programs and still has the data necessary for right interpretation by
	  BKChem. To distinguish this new format from normal SVG I use the term CD-SVG.</P
><P
>This means that you can store the drawings you create in BKChem in two formats - CDML
	  and CD-SVG. Both these formats are also available in their gzipped form (compression by
	  gzip is almost standard way to make XML files smaller) which needs usually only 10-25% of
	  the space needed by the unzipped form. Preferred file format is CD-SVG or if you need
	  smaller file size its gzipped form. If you don't need the SVG representation you can also
	  use the pure CDML. (Export to pure SVG is also available).</P
