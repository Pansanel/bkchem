>In the menu there are accelerator keys displayed on the right side of some of the
	commands. You can use these key sequences as shorcuts to trigger the respective actions
	without having to go to the menu.</P
><P
>The style of key bindings is very similar to that of Emacs. So if you are familiar
	with this concept (you know what "C-x C-f" means and how does it differ from "C-x f") you
	can skip this chapter. If you know nothing about "C-x C-f" then here is	a short intro.</P
><P
>Each key-sequence can be composed from any number of individual keystrokes. Each keystroke
	than consists of optional modifier(s) and a key. The modifiers are "C" for "Control", "M"
	for "Meta", "A" for "Alt" and "S" for "Shift". For example
	"C-x C-f" is composed of two keystrokes. The first part tells you that you should press "x"
	while holding "Control" ("C"). Then, to finish the sequence, you have press "f" together
	with "Control" again. On contrary the sequence "C-x f" has the same first keystroke but
	before you press the "f" you must release the "Control" (otherwise you will end up with "C-x
	C-f"). It is also possible to have more modifiers in one keystroke - e.g. "C-M-S-k" means
	that you have to press "k" while holding simultaneously "Control", "Meta" and "Shift"
	keys. The best way to get used to this concept is by practice. So try it inside of BKChem
	or get Emacs.</P
