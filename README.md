## Notes

* Piddle sources are shipped together with BKChem. Piddle is a library provided under the GPL license and seems to be dead since several years. Therefore it was decided to put it inside BKChem sources and distribute any eventual additions this way. In case any major changes will be made Piddle will be released as a standalone library.
* Pmw (http://pmw.sourceforge.net/) sources (version 1.2) are shipped together with BKChem. There were needed some minor fixes in Pwm and as it is a library provided under the GPL license and seems to be dead it was decided to put it inside bkchem sources and distribute the fixed version this way.
* The official InChI software from IUPAC is bundled in a binary form together with BKChem in Windows binary builds. All the credit for this nice piece of
software goes to its creators. This information comes with the software:
